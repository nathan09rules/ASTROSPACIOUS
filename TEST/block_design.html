            <h1>NEBULAS</h1>
            <h2> Nebulas are vast clouds of gas and dust in space, often stretching across light-years. They are the birthplaces of stars, forming when gravity pulls their material together until nuclear fusion begins. Some nebulas glow brightly from nearby starlight, while others appear as dark, shadowy shapes against the stars. Their stunning colors and swirling patterns make them some of the most beautiful objects in the universe.</h2>

            <h2>The Sun is a massive, glowing ball of hot gas at the center of our solar system. Made mostly of hydrogen and helium, it produces energy through nuclear fusion, releasing light and heat that make life on Earth possible. Its powerful gravity keeps the planets in orbit, while solar flares and winds shape space weather throughout the solar system.</h2>
